Hi, I'm Joe. Thanks for taking some interest in learning a bit more about me.

# Professional

I have been involved with the PostgreSQL community since 1998, and am presently a PostgreSQL Committer, Major Contributor, and Infrastructure Team member. I am also the author and original maintainer of a PostgreSQL procedural language handler for the R language, PL/R, although these days Dave Cramer does all of the heavy lifting.

Semi-related to my PostgreSQL pursuits, I am a member of the Board of Directors at Software in the Public Interest (SPI). SPI is a non-profit corporation founded to act as a fiscal sponsor for organizations that develop open source software and hardware -- the PostgreSQL project is a member organization.

For work, I am currently Head of the PostgreSQL Contributors Team at Amazon. In the past I have helped bootstrap a startup, run my own small company, developed semiconductor industry captial equipment, fabricated precision parts from exotic metals, and ridden beneath the waves on a nuclear submarine. The details are all available on my LinkedIn profile.
